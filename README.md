# Guild Wars 2 Game Mode Weapons

Select Guild Wars 2 weapons for different game modes (PvE, PvP, WvW).

## Usage

The [web page](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/andreasg123/gw2-mode-weapons/blob/master/weapon.html)
stores weapon sets for different game modes (PvE, PvP, WvW). While
specializations, traits, and skills are switched automatically for different
game modes, weapons have to be changed manually. The page stores the data in
the [local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)
of the web browser so that no account is needed and nothing is stored on the
server. Copying and pasting the data to another web browser is supported.

The web page can be used in most browsers by opening the HTML file, no web
server needed.  It needs
[lz-string](https://github.com/pieroxy/lz-string/blob/master/libs/lz-string.min.js)
to compress the data for storage.
